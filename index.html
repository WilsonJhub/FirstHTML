     <p>Empty your mind, be formless, shapeless, like water. If you put water into a cupm, it becomes the cup. 
            You put water into a bottle and it becomes the bottle. You put it in a teapot, it becomes te teapot. 
             Now water can flow or it can crash. 
                 <b>Be water my friend.</b>
